# title-and-description-checker
This PHP project allows users to upload a CSV file with URLs and automatically checks each webpage for meta titles and descriptions. It fetches the HTML content, extracts the relevant meta tags, and saves the results in a new downloadable CSV file for easy review and analysis.
